	<h4 id="whats_ontology">What is an ontology?</h4>
		<p>If you are new to ontologies, there is a 
		<a href="http://ontogenesis.knowledgeblog.org/66" target="_blank">short introduction</a> on the subject available and a blog post 
		by James Malone on <a href="http://drjamesmalone.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/common-ontology-questions-1-what-is-it.html" target="_blank">what ontologies are for</a>.
		</p>
	<h4 id="why_annotate_my_data">Why should I annotate my data with ontology?</h4>
		<p>
		The main reason to do this is to give semantics to your data. This goes a long way as it will make your data easier 
		to visualize, easier to query in a meaningful way, and easier to integrate with other data. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s say you have a datasource that consists of strings of names. Now let’s also say that there exists a ‘family’ ontology 
			that strictly describes a family tree and the relationships that exist in that tree. If you annotate your data with that 
			ontology, you can start to realise the connections between the different people. You can draw a family tree, you can add in a 
			datasource with different names (let’s say a distant relatives family tree). 
			You can also ask who is related to whom with what degree or see if the birth rate has decreased in the newer generations.
		</p>
	<h4 id="how_to_annotate">How do I annotate my data with ontologies?</h4>
		<p>
			You can start by investigating existing data-ontology term mappings using <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma" target="_blank">Zooma</a> 
			a tool for mapping text annotations to ontology term. Zooma holds a repository of existing annotation knowledge, 
			and uses the repository to search and provide high confidence mappings of data in the form of text, 
			to ontology term. If Zooma can’t find a mapping it will take a look in the Ontology Lookup Service to try and find one.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like, Zooma, you too can look into the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/old" target="_blank">Ontology Lookup Service</a> (OLS) 
			as the next step of your data annotation process. OLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a 
			single point of access to the latest ontology versions. You simply need to type in what you are looking for in the search 
			box and OLS will guide you from there. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You may find that many ontologies overlap and that you may want to annotate your data  against a defined set of ontologies 
			and not all the available ones. Thankfully there is a ontology cross references tool. 
			The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo" target="_blank">Ontology Xref Service</a> (OxO) analyses and displays the 
			connection between ontologies over multiple ‘hops’.
		</p>
		<p>
			After spending some time with these tools and digging into the depths of the bio-ontology world, you might find that no 
			suitable term for your data exists in an ontology, and that you have to create one - <a href="www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/webulous" target="_blank">Webulous</a> 
			is a tool to support ontology development from spreadsheets through a google sheet add-on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The above complete tools set can help you with your data-ontology annotation workflow. They are used across different teams in the EMBL-EBI 
			and other institutions in processes undertaken by high-volume data repositories. The above steps are just a guideline, and you 
			can use the tools independently for different tasks or combine them together and build your applications around them. Zooma, 
			OLS and OxO provide an API that you can code against, enabling the programmatic access and automation of the above processes.

	<h4 id="using_the_annotations">I have annotated my data with ontologies. Now what?</h4>
	<p>There are a lot of cool things you can do with your data now.</p>
	<p>For a hands-on example of ontology powered search, take a look at the BioSolr plugin tutorial: <a href="{{site.domain}}{{site.baseurl}}/BioSolr" target="_blank">BioSolr</a></p>
	<p>Here is a range of applications that are driven by ontologies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The GWAS Catalog generates an interactive visualisation of all SNP-Trait associations with genome wide significance: 
			<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/diagram" target="_blank">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/diagram</a>
		</li>
		<li>The Open Targets Platform achives smarter searching and data analysis: <a href="https://www.targetvalidation.org/faq#why-efo" target="_blank">Why does Open Targets use EFO?</a></li>
		<li>Different datasources that have been annotated with ontologies are easier to integrate: <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/" target="_blank">RDF Platform</a></li>
